# Elevict's CSS Snippets

These are a series of snippets I've made and remade with the intent of having a flexible and vibrant obsidian MD theme. Highly recommend pairing these snippets with (Shade Sanctuary)[https://github.com/Elevict/Shade-Sanctuary] for the best experience.

1. Animations and Background - Create a wave-like animation in the background along with some other subtle animations around your theme.
2. Colored Sidebar Items - Color your sidebar folders and files.
3. Gradient Callouts - A vast array of gradient callouts designed with the intent of creating a homepage. Needs to be paired with the (MCL Multicolumn)[https://github.com/efemkay/obsidian-modular-css-layout] snippet to function.
4. Mathematics Callouts - Series of callouts designed to make writing and categorization various theorems, definitions, and problems.
5. Gradient Headers - Headers made to be paired with the gradient callouts and some html.
6. Hoverable Dropdown - A dropdown menu for organizing huge lists of items, again made to be paired with gradient callouts and intended to be used in dark mode.
